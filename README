Qore ssh2 module

INTRODUCTION
------------
This module provides access to ssh2 sessions and the sftp protocol via libssh2
(http://www.libssh2.org) in the Qore programming language.

This version requires qore 0.8.13+ as it requires qpp to build (qpp is the Qore
Pre-Processor) and the stream API

    sudo port -vu install qore-ssh2-module


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.13+ and libssh2 1.1+ to build and run

to configure the build, execute
        configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
        configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

if libssh2 cannot be found, then you can use:
        configure --disable-debug --with-libssh2-dir=<dir>

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the
module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)
